Two socks, a blue and a yellow
Were paired up, it was mellow
But one day they got lost
In the big house, at what cost?

The blue sock found itself in the bedroom
Feeling lost and feeling glum
It searched high and low
But its companion it did not know

The yellow sock, in the living room it was found
Looking for its pair, it was astound
It searched every nook and every cranny
But its companion, it could not any

Days passed, and the socks went through their trials
The blue sock was stuck under the bed, it was a mile
The yellow sock was chased by the family cat
But they never gave up, they were not sat

Finally, they found each other, covered in dust and cobwebs
But they didn't care, they just hugged and grabbed
They vowed never to be separated again
Together forever, until the very end

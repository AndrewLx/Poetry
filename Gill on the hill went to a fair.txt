Gill on the hill went to a fair,
Her eyes shone bright with excitement and cheer.
The rides and games and food, oh my!
She couldn't wait to give them all a try.

The ferris wheel, so high in the sky,
Gave her a view of the city nearby.
The cotton candy, pink and sweet,
Was a tasty treat for Gill to eat.

The funhouse mirrors made her laugh,
As she saw her reflection in a different path.
And when the day was done,
Gill knew she had so much fun.
